# Ceja Florendo â€“ Project Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights a selection of my academic and personal engineering projects, with a focus on robotics, mechatronics, and system integration.

## Self-Balancing Roller Robot
- Designed and built a remote-controlled self-balancing robot powered by an IMU and ESP32 microcontroller, integrating gyroscopic sensing, motor actuation, and custom firmware.
- Tuned a PID controller to maintain a zero-tilt setpoint, stabilizing the robot through precise coordination and characterization of three DC motors using IMU-based feedback.
- Executed stress testing and root-cause fault analysis to refine PID gains, motor torque response, and IMU signal stability, achieving a design highly resistant to tipping under severe external disturbances.

## 2D Walking Simulation
- Built a fully dynamic 2D bipedal walker in MATLAB using Lagrangian mechanics and numerical integration to generate forward dynamics.
- Implemented PD controllers for hip and knee joints with ground contact and friction models, producing stable and repeatable gait cycles.
- Evaluated gait robustness by testing stability under perturbations such as control gain variation, ground friction changes, and walker configuration.

## Plastic Recycling Process: Fine Shredder
- Designed and wired the electrical system with motor controllers and an emergency stop, ensuring safe operation and variable power control.
- Performed FEA in SolidWorks and fatigue life calculations on the blades and shaft to validate durability and longevity.
- Produced a prototype that reliably shredded plastic waste with sub-millimeter precision.
